         <h3> CSS Flexbox Layout Module</h3>
          <p>Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:</p>
          
         <p>Block, for sections in a webpage
          Inline, for text
          Table, for two-dimensional table data
          Positioned, for explicit position of an element
          The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

               Inline, for text
               Direct child elements(s) of the flexible container automatically becomes flexible items.

          Writers write descriptive paragraphs because their purpose is to describe something. Their point is that something is beautiful or disgusting or strangely intriguing. Writers write persuasive and argument paragraphs because their purpose is to persuade or convince someone.
